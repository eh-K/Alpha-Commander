## Source code for Alpha Commander.
Have provided xdevkit.dll since you will need a local copy in order to compile.

## Issues
1. For some reason upon opening, Form11.Designer.cs appears. 
> In order to compile, delete this file before compiling.

2. Unblock Form1.resx. Windows will prevent you from compiling since the file was downloaded online...
